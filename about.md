## Who am I?

I'm James Black, a PhD student studying at the MRC Epidemiology unit, within Cambridge University.
 I live in Jesus College, Cambridge, although I'm originally from New Zealand.

# Still interested? Here is a bit more.

### The path to epidemiology

After a foray into microbiology and pharmacology via a Bachelor of Biomedical Science in 
Infection and Immunity, I moved into epidemiology with a Postgraduate Diploma in Public 
Health and a Masters in Public Health from the University of Otago. 

My work there involved synthesising quality of life recovery profiles across 
economically relevant injury categories. 
The data from this work was presented to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) injury expert 
group at the Swansea meeting, and later detailed summary estimates were provided to aid 
in developing the injury weights for the GBD 2010. I also did work modelling QALY losses 
in the elective surgery waiting lists at Victoria University. 

In London I worked on an  evaluation of the National Child Measurement 
Program at the London School of Hygiene and 
Tropical Medicine. Obesity related epidemiology led me to the MRC Epidemiology Unit, where 
I am completing a thesis exploring the relationships between diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### My interests

I am interested in learning more about the heterogeneity present in diabetes 
related outcomes. For the next few years I plan to explore the relative effect of 
different treatments, practice and patient characteristics on cardiovascular disease 
in people with type 2 diabetes.

I also have a keen interest in life at Jesus College, having served as the 
social (2012/13) and sports (2013/14) officer, as well as building 
and now maintaining the [MCR website](http://mcr.jesus.cam.ac.uk).

# Research

### Type 2 diabetes treatment, consequences and outcomes

While at the MRC Epidemiology Unit I am researching type 2 diabetes. 
The first part of my PhD is exploring the effect of intensive multifactorial 
treatment on modelled cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. 
This work highlighted the large heterogeneity in disease risk amongst people at diagnosis. 
As patient centred care is paramount in diabetes, and realistic goal setting is 
essential in this process, I plan to further explore this 
heterogeneity over the next 3 years.

### Child obesity health pathway

At London School I was employed on two studies within an NIHR programme grant 
involving child obesity in the United Kingdom. The first study was on the impact of the 
National Child Measurement Programme on parental knowledge, intent to change 
and perceptions of child obesity. The second study aimed to develop an interactive tool 
aid GPs and practice nurses in the management of children with obesity in a primary 
care setting. I remained in close contact with the team at London School, as well as 
other collaborators at UCLH, and have enjoyed remaining a part of this 
research in my spare time.

### Quality of life norms after injury

At the University of Otago I completed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 
10,429 patients health related quality of life after injury. 
This was assessed by combining raw study data within a multi-level mixed effects model 
to address study heterogeneity. This thesis aimed to provide a descriptive benchmark of 
quality of life norms after injury and has since been included as one of the many data 
sources used as injury estimates in the GBD-2010 project.
